A computer network is a set of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and printers, allowing them to communicate and share resources via wired or wireless connections. Its main function is to facilitate efficient data and resource sharing, boosting collaborative work. The history of networking began in the mid-20th century, with ARPANET in the late 1960s marking a pivotal development by introducing packet-switching technology, fundamental to current networks, along with the evolution of protocols like TCP/IP, which underpin the Internet.

Computer networks are classified by scale, architecture, and purpose. Based on geographic reach, they can be divided into LANs (Local Area Networks), WANs (Wide Area Networks), and MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks). LANs serve limited areas like homes or offices, while WANs cover extensive regions, exemplified by the Internet, and MANs span intermediary zones, such as cities. In terms of architecture, networks may be peer-to-peer, where each device acts as both client and server, or client-server, which involves a central server managing resources.

Networks rely on protocols, rules governing data exchange. Key protocols include TCP/IP, which ensures reliable transmission by managing data packet integrity and routing. Other vital protocols are HTTP/HTTPS for web browsing, FTP for file transfers, and SMTP/IMAP for emails. 

Physical network components, like routers and switches, are crucial. Routers manage data flow between networks for Internet access, while switches connect devices within a network, facilitating efficient data transfer.
